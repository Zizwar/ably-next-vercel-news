# Ably/Next Realtime News

This is a demo app using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Ably](https://ably.com) with the Ably's [react-hooks](https://github.com/ably-labs/react-hooks) `npm` module.

It demonstrates use of:

- Pub/sub messaging
- Channel presence
- History

You can test it out by visiting the [Vercel deployment](https://ably-next-vercel-news.vercel.app/) in multiple pages.

To run it locally, fork this repo and add an `.env.local` file containing your Ably API key:

```
ABLY_API_KEY=your.api-key:goes-here
```
